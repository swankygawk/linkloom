# Contributing to LinkLoom

First off, thank you for your interest in LinkLoom! I'm really glad you find this project interesting.

## A Personal Learning Project

Please note that this is a personal pet project created for my own learning and experimentation. The primary goal is for me to explore the full development lifecycle of a modern web application.

## Contributions

Because this is a personal learning journey, **I am not currently accepting external contributions, issues, or pull requests.** This allows me to work through the challenges and learn at my own pace.

If you'd like to experiment with the code, please feel free to fork this repository. You are welcome to use the code for your own purposes in accordance with the MIT License.

Thank you for your understanding!
